# n
An operating system for The Magic Mainframe's n-series class of enterprise computers. 

## About
Ever notice how the letter `N` looks like the letter `Z` tipped on
its side?

## How?
Legally, hopefully. The idea is simple. Implement all of the 
authorized and unauthorized assembler services in the public domain. 
The interfaces are all publicly documented.
* [Authorized Assembler Services Guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/latest?topic=mvs-zos-programming-authorized-assembler-services-guide)
* [Assembler Services Guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/latest?topic=mvs-zos-programming-assembler-services-guide)

Data areas are also documented.

Aim for source and binary compatibility with existing software 
created for IBM Z mainframes.

## Why?
Because I'm mad. And because nobody else will.

## When?
"If not now, when?"

Probably when I'm not subject to the whims of capitalism? So 
whenever I have a spare moment, I guess.

## Who?
Just me, unless Boardy AI can find someone as equally unhinged, 
deranged, unhasped, and angry as I am.

## What?
The goal of this project is to create an alternative operating
system for IBM Z mainframe computers.

## Why?
For shits and giggles. "I'm going to create my own operating system 
with blackjack and hookers!"

That's a Futurama reference.

## Are you OK?
No. Don't worry, I'm in therapy. Have been for a long time. Thanks
for your concern.
